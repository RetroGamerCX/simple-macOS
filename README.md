Meet the simple macOS. With just three commands, you're ready to run macOS on any linux distro. The project is based on Alan Pope's project, the Sosumi snap, which is based on the macOS-Simple-KVM project.
First of all you need to know if your computer can handle this virtual machine. Here are the requirements I recommend for the host computer:

At least 8GiB of RAM

120 GB of free disk space

2-core or more processor

A Linux distro

Then you need to run the command:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RetroGamerCX/simple-macOS/master/simple%20macOS%20installer.sh

to get the installation script.

After that, just type 'sudo chmod +x 'simple macOS installer.sh'', then './simple macOS installer.sh' and that's it, the machine is almost installed. Now just install macOS
